## Airports
 	
In this exercise, you have to find the closest route between two airports.
 
Write a function findRoutes(source, destination) that efficiently outputs all possible routes sorted by distance.
 
#### INPUT:
Line 1: N, the number of segments
Line 2: ORIGIN, the IATA code of the origin
Line 2: DESTINATION, the IATA code of the destination
Line 3 to N+3: The N segments expressed as ORIGIN DESTINATION DISTANCE
 
#### OUTPUT:

    Display ORIGIN if no segment is provided
    Otherwise, display the list of possible itineraries sorted by distance

 
#### CONSTRAINTS:
0 â‰¤ N < 1000

PYTHON CODE TO READ INPUT:

import sys

n = int(raw_input())
origin = raw_input()
destination = raw_input()
segments = []
for i in xrange(n):
    segments.append(raw_input())

print "Hello World!"

EXAMPLE:
Input
6
SFO
MSP
SFO SEA 679
SEA MSP 1399
SFO LAX 338
PHX SEA 1107
LAX PHX 370
PHX MSP 1276

#### Output
SFO -> LAX -> PHX -> MSP
SFO -> SEA -> MSP
SFO -> LAX -> PHX -> SEA -> MSP

    The program has to read inputs from standard input
    The program has to write the solution to standard output
    The program must run in the test environment
